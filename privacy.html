                    <li>
                        if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Data to comply with any legal

                        agencies investigating illegal activities;

                    transfer
                    your data to another country, such a country must have an adequate data protection law. Where we
                    need to
                    send your data to a country without an adequate data protection law, we shall ensure that such
                    transfer
                    is subject only to the exceptions contained in Article 2.12 of the Nigeria Data Protection
                    Regulation
                    2019.

                <h2>
                    Where We Store Your Personal Data
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The Personal Data that we collect from you will be transferred to and stored at destinations within
                    Nigeria. By submitting your Personal Data, you agree to this transfer, storing, or processing. We
                    will
                    take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Data is treated securely and in
                    accordance with this Policy.
                </p>

                <h2>Retention Duration of Personal Data</h2>

                <p>
                    Your Personal Data will not be retained for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it
                    was
                    processed unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of
                    your
                    personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, and whether we can achieve
                    those
                    purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In general terms, we will retain your personal data for the duration of your involvement/engagement
                    with
                    us and for as long as reasonably necessary afterward; however, we may maintain different retention
                    periods for different products and services.

                        you.
                    </li>

                    <li>
